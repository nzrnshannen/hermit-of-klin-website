                        <p>Tchaikovsky was a Russian composer of the Romantic period and most famous for his ballets. Born: 7 May 1840 in Russia. Died: 6 November 1893 in Russia. Tchaikovsky is often described as the first Russian composer to gain long-lasting, international acclaim.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Tchaikovsky began to truly merge the drama and emotion of the Romantic period with the symphonic form in his Fourth Symphony.</p>

                            His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.

                            He began taking piano lessons in 1845; however, formal music education was not available in Russian schools at this time so his parents never considered that he might pursue a career in music. Instead, they prepared him for a life of civil service; he began his formal education at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in 1850, which he attended for nine years.
